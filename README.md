ðŸš« HATE SPEECH DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING (DL) :



Hate speech detection involves identifying abusive, offensive, or discriminatory language in text using machine learning techniques. Deep Learning (DL) has become a powerful tool for this task due to its ability to learn complex patterns from large datasets.



Key Steps in DL-Based Hate Speech Detection:


Text Preprocessing:

Raw text is cleaned by removing noise (special characters, URLs) and normalized (lowercasing, stemming).


Model Selection:

CNNs: Detect local patterns (e.g., slurs) via convolutional filters.

RNNs/LSTMs: Analyze sequential context for sarcasm or implicit hate.

Transformers (BERT, GPT): Leverage self-attention to understand nuanced hate speech

Training & Evaluation:

Models are trained on labeled datasets (e.g., HateXplain, Twitter Hate Speech) and evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
